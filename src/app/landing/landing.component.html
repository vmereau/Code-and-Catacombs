      <p>
        This is an experimental game to test out the limits of LLM AI like Gemini 2.0
        and text to image like DALL-E.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game's story, characters, skills are all generated by the AI using prompts
        and responses in JSON format.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not intended to be a well-adjusted experience as the AI can create
        janky, unfair scenarios or just make your character too strong.
      </p>
      <p>This is aimed to be a 5-10 minute experience, please Enjoy.</p>
