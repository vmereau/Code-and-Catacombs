<h1>Welcome to Code & Catacombs</h1>

<h2>A roguelike RPG generated by AI.</h2>

<p>
  This is an experimental game to tests out the limits of LLM AI like Gemini 2.0
  and text to image like DALL-E
</p>
<p>
  The game's story, characters, skills are all generated by the AI using prompts
  and responses in JSON format
</p>
<p>
  This is not intended to be a well adjusted experience as the AI can create
  janky, unfair scenarios or just make your character too strong
</p>
<p>This is aimed to be a 5-10 minute experience, please Enjoy</p>
